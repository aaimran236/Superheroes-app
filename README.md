# Superheroes App

This repository contains the code for a simple Android application that displays a list of superheroes. This project was developed as part of the Android Basics with Compose Unit 3 Pathway 3 practice problem.

**Credits:** This project is based on the "Superheroes" practice project from the [Android Basics with Compose course](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-practice-superheroes). Full credit goes to the Android Developers team for providing this excellent learning resource.

## What You'll Learn

By exploring this project and comparing my independent solution with the official one, you can gain valuable insights into:

* **Jetpack Compose Fundamentals:**
    * Building UI with Composable functions.
    * Working with `LazyColumn` for efficient display of scrollable lists.
    * Structuring Composable hierarchies effectively.
* **Material Design Principles:**
    * Applying Material Design elements for a modern and intuitive UI.
    * Theming your Compose app (colors, typography, shapes).
* **Data Handling:**
    * Defining data classes to represent your app's data (e.g., `Hero` objects).
    * Populating lists with sample data.
* **Animation in Compose :**
    * Implementing basic animations using Compose's animation APIs (e.g., `animateItem`, `AnimatedVisibility`).
    * Understanding how to add visual flair to list items for a more engaging user experience.
* **Independent Problem Solving vs. Best Practices:**
    * The value of attempting a solution independently to solidify understanding.
    * Learning to refine and improve code by comparing it with well-structured, official solutions.
